<p>Hypertext Markup Language </p>
<p><strong>HTML is a markup language</strong> that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. </p>
